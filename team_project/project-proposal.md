# Project Proposal


## Project Title
50 Most Influential Artists

## Summary of your website's purpose
The website provides information about the 50 most famous artists from the 14th to 20 century (each on a new page) with the ability to filter artists by year , genre, etc., and search the artist by name.

## Summary of the dataset
The dataset is essentially a collection of artworks of the 50 most influential artists of all time. The dataset is a CSV file containing the year, genre, biography, nationality, bio, wikipedia page, and number of paintings for these 50 artists and 8355 images of their art. We will manually downsize the data by only leaving 1-2 artworks for each artist. ~~We will also host the rest of the images on a different server and load them from our website because of file limit restrictions.~~

## Audience and goals

- As someone interested in learning about famous artists across the western art history,
  - I would like to have the option to learn about a random artist because I don’t know any of them yet.
  - I would like to see similar work to the work I’m currently seeing.
  - I would like to learn about the biography of the artist and what school of art they came from.
  - I would like to have the option of reading more about the artist from other references.


- As an art historian stumbling upon the website,
  - I would like to filter artists by genre, year, and nationality.
  - I would like to view all the artwork done by an artist at the same time.
  - I would like to have the option of exporting the data to a PDF to share with my students.


- As a student, 
  - I want to be able to filter artists by time period and genre so that I can select a relevant artist as the focus for a school project.
  - I want to be able to view examples of different artists’ paintings so that I can compare their styles.

- As an art teacher, 
  - I want to be able to view a biography of each artist so that I can engage my students and provide them with historical context when introducing an artist.
