## Teamwork

### Communication

-   Slack group
    
-   Zoom if not able to meet in person
    
-   share progress when work is done
    
-   check in if not in class
    
-   ask questions, and answer questions within day if able
    
-   *respectful:* show appreciation for others’ effort and insight, discuss pros/cons if disagreement
    

### Participation

-   ask people what tasks they want to work on
    
-   communicate if task is unmanageable
    
-   offer help if task is completed
    
-   time commitment may vary by week, but try to stay ahead of schedule to reduce future stress
    
-   *need more details on project to understand the stages/checkpoints/deliverables throughout course term and how much class time is dedicated to work*
    

### Roles (how we will use our strengths)

-   **Lane:** document meeting notes, track progress/challenges to follow up on with Amy if needed (using GitHub project)
    
-   **Walt:** Preferably work on front end (e.g., html templates), evaluating and making front end usability decisions that are open to suggestions
    
-   **Yusuf:** Divide big tasks into smaller ones, suggest new techniques and features, preferably work on backend
    
-   We will divide the work by expertise and by voting. Yusuf will mainly be doing backend, Walt will mainly be doing Frontend, and Lane will mainly be doing controller. We said “mainly” because each one will have the opportunity to contribute in other areas and to learn about them as well.
    
-   Meaningful participation will be tracked using the meeting notes and the GitHub projects page so that we are all learning and contributing to the project equally. We will value meaningful participation by celebrating checkpoints or deliverables.

## Disagreements and Conflicts

We will try to reach consensus or find a “happy medium” if there is disagreement. If someone is not living up to expectations, we will try to divide the tasks into discrete ones instead of big tasks so that progress can be made. If the problem persists, we should meet and discuss what could be going wrong and how we can handle it. Finally, if there is a major concern we cannot resolve, we will try to meet with Amy as a final resort.
